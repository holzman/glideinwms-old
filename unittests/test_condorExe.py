        Test the iexe_cmd function for errors.  There are two sets of worker
        functions that will be executed.  The first set writes 20k lines to
        stdout and exits normally (exit code: 0).  The second also writes 20k
        lines to stdout, but these exit abnormally (exit code: 1).  Both sets
        of scripts consist of one written in python and one written in shell
        script (bash).

        The original code for iexe_cmd would block if the buffer was filled and
        EOF wasn't in the buffer.  The code was re-written to handle that use
        case, but still blocked because the write side could still fill the
        buffer without appending EOF.  There are two solutions.  One, give the
        buffer read command a ridiculously small buffer size (but even that
        isn't a guarantee since the read side doesn't know hat the buffer size
        should be), or two, make the read buffers non-blocking.

        Option two was selected.  This unittest tests both the blocking
        condition and error handling in the function.
