The layout of the code has changed significantly.  Now instead of doing crazy 
imports, you only need to add the root directory to PYTHONPATH (preferably in 
the startup scripts for non-rpm installed systems).  For FHS compliant installs
you don't even need to do that.  The python packages are already in the system
path.

Development is easier as well.  For those using an IDE, merely add the root 
directory to the python path and all the context sensitive features of the IDE
will find the packages.  Pylint will be much happier since we now can point it 
at the packages rather than individual files.


Directory layout mappings for FHS compliant systems:

+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Source Directory         | FHS Directory                                             |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| bin                      | /usr/bin                                                  |
| etc                      | /etc/glideinwms                                           |
| web_base                 | /usr/share/glideinwms                                     |
