        Bug Fix: proxy_info works correctly with the cat option

v2_7    glideinwms code is now organized as python packages
        Factory no longer creates long running process per entry. Instead, it
          runs only a single long running glideFactoryEntryGroup process
          instead of multiple glideFactoryEntry processes. Factory config
          supports two additional config attributes entry_parallel_workers
          and update_thread_count (see factory configuration docs for details)
        Improved factory prerformance by migrating popen calls to use python's
          subprocess library
        Improved the performance of the Frontend by using pre-clustering in

          group (element) processes would inherit their parent's environment
          corrupting their own environment
        Bug Fix: Glidein's job wrapper now behaves as true wrapper
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where frontend_startup would not correctly pick
          default frontend.xml

          grid-proxy-info and voms-proxy-info binaries on the worker node
        Bug Fix: Frontend now counts the partitionable slots correctly

v2_6_2  Factory now supports glidein failure modes. This information is
          propagated back to the factory.
        Glideins now have different idle timeouts for startup and tail. The
          glideins now exit much faster after comleting jobs and they do not
          have enough time left to run another job.
        Added support for javascriptRRD 2.6.2
        Consolidate the condor_tarball tag in glideinwms.xml to read in a list
          of os, arch, version. See docs for details.
        Ini-installer will default collector_port to 9618 if not specified in
          appropriate config sections.

        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where v2.6.1 frontend would crash under certain
        Bug Fix: Installers do not set CONDOR_VERSION as constant by default.
          This will now enable frontends to override this attr.
        Bug Fix: Ini-installer now correctly cleans up files on re-install

v2_6_1  Factory now limits the speed at which it releases held glideins. After 
          too many unrecoverable attempts, held glideins are removed.
        Added support for Condor 7.8+
          KNOWN ISSUE: Only applies if you upgrade condor binaries in place
          without using the installer. Upgrading condor binaries for user pool
          and the wms collector with multiple schedds should not be done without
          corresponding changes to the condor configuration file. If the
          JOB_QUEUE_LOG is not correctly configured for each sched, condor
          queue will be corrupted for all the scheds
        Glideins now support curl & data file transfer plugins in condor
        New installations of factory and frontend services now communicate with
          condor daemons using TCP by default.
        Bug Fix: Factory configuration now supports specifying limits for 
          different security classes of same frontend
          KNOWN ISSUE: If limits are configured in the factory, this change
          breaks backward compatibility. As a workaround, admin needs to remove
          the limits and re-apply them.
        Bug Fix: Factory monitoring pages now correctly work in Firefox 14+
        Bug Fix: Frontend now monitors the glideins correctly when the 
          corresponding factory classad is missing
        Bug Fix: Fixed factory logging. Factory can now correctly extract info
          from a voms proxy
        Bug Fix: Factory now correctly logs the Completed jobs info in rrd

v2_6    Add attr_dict in the environment of the frontend match_expr
        Config defined attributes are now available in match_expr
        Factory now supports deleting entries using --force_delete
        Upgrading glideinwms with changes to the monitoring rrds is supported
        Frontend advertises its monitoring url to the factory
        Misbehaving glidein can be put on hold using WANT_HOLD
        The start_expr is now a native part of match
        Startd now advertises per-slot memory when configured by the factory.
          VO frontend can use GLIDEIN_MaxMemMBs_Estimate attr to make glidein 
          estimate the available memory (based on memory/core or memory/cpu)
        entry_q now reads GLIDEIN_FACTORY_DIR from env before checking cwd
        Multiple user collectors are supported in HA mode
        Factory can specify if glexec required vs provided by site
        Providing config file locations for glideinwms.xml and frontend.xml is
          optional during reconfig
        Entry downtime reason is now reported in the glidefactory classad
        Improved support for RHEL 6 platform
        Added support for new ARC Gatekeeper 1.x

          the image size during condor daemon benchmarking
        Bug Fix: Glidein correctly handles semicolons in STARTER_JOB_ENVIRONMENT
        Bug Fix: Frontend correctly correctly supports <attr> properties
        Bug Fix: Glidein now correctly finds glexec on glite site
        Bug Fix: Glideins update the user collector using TCP by default
        Bug Fix: Ini-Installer now correctly works with condor tarball on RHEL6

        Bug Fix: MaxJobRetirementTime and PREEMPT expressions now correctly
          work with WANT_HOLD
        Bug Fix: Factory correctly deals with the situation when the frontend
          changes the proxy used
        Bug Fix: It is possible to specify limits for different frontends for
          an entry in the factory config
        Bug Fix: Glidein sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so condor uses local shared
          libraries before those in system path
        KNOWN ISSUE: When the monitor work_dir is moved, reconfig/upgrade will
          fail. Recommended work-around is to delete the xml configuration in
          the work directory, change the work directory, then reconfig/upgrade.
        KNOWN ISSUE: If the work directory has changed, frontend startup
          upgrade will not create the group directories and then the frontend
          will fail (silently). If you are changing directories (e.g. from a RPM
          upgrade), you should copy the group directories manually.


v2_5_7
	Patch of the clean_glidein_queue to return 1 only when something was
	  really done
	Fix handling of held jobs when hitting the held limit
	Fix log messages that printed out wrong held limits

	Bug Fix: Installer now correctly works with the RPM OSG client
        Bug Fix: ReqMaxIdle was grossly overestimated before.
        Bug Fix: Fixed bug in factory monitoring web pages where the link
          generation was off by one for monitoring groups

          factory
        Bug Fix: glexec_setup.sh now uses correct proxy for its tests

v2_5_4  Added support for VDT pre installed via rpm. While using
          ini-installer set vdt_location to empty and
          x509_cert_dir=/etc/grid-security/certificates
        Consolidated some of the frontend rpm related patches
        Added support for rsl in glideinWMS.xml to map to cream_attributes

        Made quering of schedds efficient where ever possible.
        Add autocomplete/search to table in frontendGroupGraphStatusNow.html
        Added 'upgrade' option to factory startup script so that all the
          files in the glidein submit directory are updated.  Did the same for
          the frontend startup script. 'reconfig' only updates the files
          populated with information from the configuration files (no scripts).
        The OSG rpm worker node client requires changes to glidein startup
          scripts. If you plan on using OSG sites that have used this rpm, you
          must "upgrade" your factory in order to get glideins.
        Bug fix: If there is no GLOBUS_LOCATION available to glidein, it will
          not exit
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where factory would not advertise the entry under

          GSI_DAEMON_PROXY correctly in frontend.condor_config
        Bug fix: Writeback of config files on reconfig is now enable by default
        Bug fix: Frontend does better error reporting when quering user pool or
          the schedd fails
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug in condor log parsing when we encounter event 400
          (Job was evicted)
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where factory would not correctly accept requests
          from frontends that were still using old keys

          set be required.
        Bug Fix: Revert the glidein shutdown behavior introduced in v2_5_2
        Bug Fix: Add condor_glexec_update_proxy to Condor tarball if available

v2_5_2  Frontend publishes glideresource classad to the pool collector. This
          is useful for the users to do match making for their jobs.
        Useful job info like JOB_Site, JOB_GLIDEIN_Entry_Name, JOB_GLIDEIN_Name
          JOB_GLIDEIN_Factory, JOB_GLIDEIN_Schedd, JOB_GLIDEIN_ClusterId,
          JOB_GLIDEIN_ProcId, JOB_GLIDEIN_Site is now added to SUBMIT_EXPRS
        Default GLEXEC_JOB = True when GLEXEC_BIN is set to use glexec
        Factory can now resue old public key after startup to decrypt
          frontend requests. Grace time for old public key is configurable.
        The frontend now can set global limits on number of glideins.
        The frontend now can use more than a single CPU.
        glexec now tested during initial validation.
        Bug fix frontend: Do not double count glideins when using multiple
          groups.
        Bug fix frontend: Respect per-entry running limits.
        Bug fix factory: The factory was not properly checking the security
          classes and setting downtimes.
        Bug fix factory: Improper termination of glideins because of
          SIGHUP is handled correctly
        Bug fix factory: Daylight savings is now correctly accounted for.

          Condor Configuration
          - Documented the internal communication protocol through classads

v2_5_1  Factory now can remove excessive glideins

          entries.
        Improved frontend logging.
        Add Java support in the glideins.
        Changed factory monitoring. It is now based on security names and not
          plain frontend names
        Improved installation process using ini based installer.

	Fixed how voms_proxy_init is looked for after VDT install
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where Summarize.listStored() in CondorMonitor.py
	  returned the wrong value
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in factory monitoring that prevented proper
	  aggregation of sites
	BUG FIX: Correctly interpret DN from a voms proxy generated from a
	  service certificate.
	BUG FIX: Generate frontend's condor_config without empty values for
	  certain configuration options. Empty values is not the right way to
	  reset the configuration options.


v2_4_2	Fixed the incompatibility introduced in v2_4_1 in monitoring components.

v2_4_1	Add a new configuration option for PREEMPT_GRACE_TIME
	Move configuration of GLIDEIN_Job_Max_Time from the factory to the
	  frontend
	In factory config added checks to make sure Factory configuration is
	  consistent w.r.t CONDOR_ARCH, CONDOR_VERSION, CONDOR_OS
	Monitoring enhancement to make selection/deselection of groups/entries
	  easier
	Support GLIDEIN_Glexec_Use in frontend config attrs. Frontend can
	  mandate or make the use of GLEXEC optional. Used in conjunction with
	  GLEXEC_BIN in factory config. If GLEXEC_BIN in set to NONE for an
	  entry in factory config, it is assumed that the entry doesn't have
	  GLEXEC configured on site.
	Improvements to documentation
	BUG FIX: Allow the use of the same DN for both the security and the
	  collector
	BUG FIX: Returning invalid variable during proxy creation
	KNOWN ISSUES: Running glideinWMS v2_4_1 with Condor 7.5.3 has not been
	  tested. Altough, most of the things may work, security changes in
	  Condor may affect your installation.


v2_4	Add proxy security classes to the frontend
	Add SecurityName to the frontend.
	Add DNs for frontend proxy and all the daemons the frontend talks to;
	  create own Condor config file and gldiein gridmap file out of them.
	Frontend now dynalically creates GLIDEIN_Collector.
	Frontend now requires Match authentication.
	Add frontend autentication info to the factory config.
	Add support for different frontend identities in different WMS
	  collectors.
	Put log files in a separate tree.
	Put client logs and client proxies in separate trees.
	Implement privilege separation in the factory.
	Various minor refactoring of code to achieve the above.
	Aggregate gatekeeper/sites for factory monitoring. 
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct 
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not 
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3_2	Fixed a security bug in the way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
	  you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
	  should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
	  installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
	  glideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
	  add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN 
	  tool available in the glideinWMS/install directory.

v2_3_1	Updated documentation. This is document change only release
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct 
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not 
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3	Attempt to restart a crashed entry few times before shutting down the
	  factory. Restarting is allowed for max restart_attempts in time
	  interval restart_interval sec in te factory. 
	Add vacuum option to manageDowntimes.
	Factory now properly handles new-style frontends without a group.
	Frontend code has been refactored to allow use as a library.
	More protections in place.
        Fixed a security bug in key handling. BREAKES BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY! But it is needed.
	Fixed a bug in glidein_startup.sh that prevented the passing of * as a parameter value
	Fixed a logical bug in the glidein config that resulted in job preemption.
	Added support for condor_ssh (v7.4 and up)
	Add support for unquoted string to be published in classads. The type is 'expr'
	Documentation Changes
	Minor bugs fixed.
 	KNOWN ISSUES: If using condor 7.4.0-7.4.2 and 7.5.0, USE_VOMS_ATTRIBUTESshould be set to false for Collector and negotiator to avoid potential problems and memory leaks in GSI libraries.

v2_2	Bug Fix: GLEXEC_JOB and GLEXEC_STARTER were not published in glideins
          classds. This was preventing psuedo interactive monitoring to work
          in case of GLEXEC.
	Made VDT optional.
	Addedd support for VDT 2.0, and made it the default.
	  Added Globus-Client and Myproxy-Client in the minimal VDT install.
	Installer now allows the collector to run on non-standard port.
	Factory now only checks X509_USER_PROXY if it needs it.  
	Added support for multiple versions of condor in a single factory.
	Added ReqEncIdentity to the frontend->factory protocol 
	   to prevent replay attacks.
	   WARNING: This effectively prevents old-style frontends to talk
                    to new style factories.
	   NOTE: Will only work with Condor 7.3.1 or newer
	KNOWN ISSUES: Pseudo interactive monitoring will not work with glexec. 

v2_1	Fixed a bug that was throwing an exception if a glidein failed.
	Fixed handling of grid-mapfiles coming from client.
	Fixed support for nordugrid.
	Improvements to the monitoring.
	Improvements to the installer.
        Improved documentation.

v2_0	Refactoring creation libs;
	  create_frontend and create_glidein now share much code
	Added create_frontend, recreate_frontend.
	Frontend now has a stage web area and passes it to the factory
	  Factory publishes list of supported signtypes and
            frontend uses this for factory selection
	  User provided code in the glidein API changed
	    The 2nd arg is now one of main|entry|client|client_group
	Added tools/glidein_status.py.
	The monitoring page now has client-side monitoring based on
            javascriptRRD.
	Support multiple proxies... frontend drives this via plugins.

v1_6_3 Fixed a security bug in way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
          you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
          should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
          installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
          glideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
          add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN
          tool available in the glideinWMS/install directory.
