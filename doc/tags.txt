vNext	Bug Fix: Correctly interpret DN from a voms proxy generated from a 
	  service certificate.
	Bug Fix: Generate frontend's condor_config without empty values for
	  certain configuration options. Empty values is not the right way to
	  reset the configuration options.
	Add support for use of TCP in condor_advertise
	Add support for condor_advertise -multiple (Condor v7.5.4+)
	Improved factory stopping procedure

v2_4_2	Fixed the incompatibility introduced in v2_4_1 in monitoring components.

v2_4_1	Add a new configuration option for PREEMPT_GRACE_TIME
	Move configuration of GLIDEIN_Job_Max_Time from the factory to the frontend
	In factory config added checks to make sure Factory configuration is
	  consistent w.r.t CONDOR_ARCH, CONDOR_VERSION, CONDOR_OS
	Monitoring enhancement to make selection/deselection of groups/entries
	  easier
	Support GLIDEIN_Glexec_Use in frontend config attrs. Frontend can
	  mandate or make the use of GLEXEC optional. Used in conjunction with
	  GLEXEC_BIN in factory config. If GLEXEC_BIN in set to NONE for an
	  entry in factory config, it is assumed that the entry doesn't have
	  GLEXEC configured on site.
	Improvements to documentation
	BUG FIX: Allow the use of the same DN for both the security and the
	  collector
	BUG FIX: Returning invalid variable during proxy creation
	KNOWN ISSUES: Running glideinWMS v2_4_1 with Condor 7.5.3 has not been
	  tested. Altough, most of the things may work, security changes in
	  Condor may affect your installation.


v2_4	Add proxy security classes to the frontend
	Add SecurityName to the frontend.
	Add DNs for frontend proxy and all the daemons the frontend talks to;
	  create own Condor config file and gldiein gridmap file out of them.

	Frontend now requires Match authentication.
	Add frontend autentication info to the factory config.
	Add support for different frontend identities in different WMS
	  collectors.
	Put log files in a separate tree.
	Put client logs and client proxies in separate trees.
	Implement privilege separation in the factory.
	Various minor refactoring of code to achieve the above.
	Aggregate gatekeeper/sites for factory monitoring. 
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct 
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not 
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3	Attempt to restart a crashed entry few times before shutting down the
	  factory. Restarting is allowed for max restart_attempts in time
	  interval restart_interval sec in te factory. 
	Add vacuum option to manageDowntimes.
	Factory now properly handles new-style frontends without a group.
	Frontend code has been refactored to allow use as a library.
	More protections in place.
        Fixed a security bug in key handling. BREAKES BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY! But it is needed.
	Fixed a bug in glidein_startup.sh that prevented the passing of * as a parameter value
	Fixed a logical bug in the glidein config that resulted in job preemption.
	Added support for condor_ssh (v7.4 and up)
	Add support for unquoted string to be published in classads. The type is 'expr'
	Documentation Changes
	Minor bugs fixed.
 	KNOWN ISSUES: If using condor 7.4.0-7.4.2 and 7.5.0, USE_VOMS_ATTRIBUTESshould be set to false for Collector and negotiator to avoid potential problems and memory leaks in GSI libraries.

v2_2	Bug Fix: GLEXEC_JOB and GLEXEC_STARTER were not published in glideins
          classds. This was preventing psuedo interactive monitoring to work
          in case of GLEXEC.
	Made VDT optional.
	Addedd support for VDT 2.0, and made it the default.
	  Added Globus-Client and Myproxy-Client in the minimal VDT install.
	Installer now allows the collector to run on non-standard port.
	Factory now only checks X509_USER_PROXY if it needs it.  
	Added support for multiple versions of condor in a single factory.
	Added ReqEncIdentity to the frontend->factory protocol 
	   to prevent replay attacks.
	   WARNING: This effectively prevents old-style frontends to talk
                    to new style factories.
	   NOTE: Will only work with Condor 7.3.1 or newer
	KNOWN ISSUES: Pseudo interactive monitoring will not work with glexec. 

v2_1	Fixed a bug that was throwing an exception if a glidein failed.
	Fixed handling of grid-mapfiles coming from client.
	Fixed support for nordugrid.

	    The 2nd arg is now one of main|entry|client|client_group
	Added tools/glidein_status.py.

            javascriptRRD.

v1_6+	The XML file now supports comments.
	Installer uses both .profile and .bashrc.
	Frontend now requires integrity checks when talking to
	  the WMS collector.
	Refactored install options so that most tasks performed
          as a non-privileged user.
	Added create_frontend, recreate_frontend.
	Refactoring creation libs;
	  create_frontend and create_glidein now share much code 
	Using m2crypto for sha1 checks.
	Added support for CCB.
        Monitoring refactored
          Most rrd operations now in separate module
